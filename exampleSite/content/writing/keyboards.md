The mouse was a mistake.

Not really. But hear me out.

When you use a mouse, you're constantly context-switching. Eyes scan for the target. Hand moves. Click. Eyes verify. Hand returns to keyboard.

With keyboard navigation, your hands never leave home row. Your eyes can stay on the content. The interface becomes invisible.

## The Vim Philosophy

Vim users know this. Modal editing seems bizarre until it clicks. Then you can't go back.

```
hjkl - movement
w/b - word jump
gg/G - file start/end
/pattern - search
```

Everything at your fingertips. Literally.

## Applied to the Web

What if websites worked this way?

- `j`/`k` for up/down
- `Enter` to select
- `Escape` to go back

No hunting for tiny buttons. No endless scrolling. Just intent, executed instantly.

That's what TUI Nav is about.
