Why build a website that looks like a terminal?

## Nostalgia

There's something satisfying about the simplicity of text interfaces. No distractions, just content.

## Speed

Keyboard nav feels snappy and fun.

## The Cursor

The blinking green cursor is iconic. It says "I'm ready. What's next?"

That's all you need.
